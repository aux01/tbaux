Tests in this directory are just normal programs that generate output and exit
zero on success and non-zero on failure. There is no framework per se.

The `make test' target builds and runs all tests in this directory.

The `runtest' program in this directory runs one or more tests and reports
output only when a test failure occurs. Use it like this:

    test/runtest tkbd_parse_test

Tests written in C typically use printf(3) to provide context information and
assert(3) to check state and abort. On failure, test output is provided and the
failed assertion should output the file and line number. That's typically enough
to go on.

It's also possible to load a test in gdb and break at an assertion failure to
get a backtrace, inspect memory state, etc.

    make profile=test debug
    gdb test/tkbd_parse_test
    (gdb) run
    <breaks on failure>
    (gdb) bt

Termbox compatibility library

termlib started life as a fork of termbox¹ but grew pretty quickly into a
different type of project.

These are the original forked termbox sources modified to work with termlib. The
idea is for them to eventually be a compatibility shim that could be used to
quickly port existing termbox programs to termlib.

The termbox interface consists of only 12 functions:

        tb_init()                // initialization
        tb_shutdown()            // shutdown

        tb_width()               // width of the terminal screen
        tb_height()              // height of the terminal screen

        tb_clear()               // clear buffer
        tb_present()             // sync internal buffer with terminal

        tb_put_cell()
        tb_change_cell()

        tb_select_input_mode()   // change input mode
        tb_peek_event()          // peek a keyboard event
        tb_poll_event()          // wait for a keyboard event

See the the termbox.h file for more details.
